IT-145 Final Project

Description: The final project of IT-145 was intended to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming principles by creating a project that utilized inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to implement a modular design. The purpose of this program was to create a system that contains information about rescue animals that are then destined as service animals. The system handles two kinds of animals Dogs and Monkeys. The system's purpose is to maintain a database of the animals in the form of array lists that contain animal objects. The program allows the user to add new monkeys and new dogs into the system, check for all the animals that are reserved, print a list of all the monkeys, and all the dogs, and print a list of the animals that are not reserved. The language used for this project is Java, and it was developed through Eclipse IDE.
The biggest challenge that I encountered in this project was the input validation part. The reason why I found this specific part challenging was that, from our initial given code, almost all, if not all, the variables and objects were of type String, which meant, the user could type anything, and it could have been easily accepted even though it was not the correct input. I consider that one of the things that I do not appreciate about Java is that we have to tell the scanner what is receiving, with scanner types like nextInt(), next().CharAt(), to name a few, even before the input is processed. Receiving the wrong type will immediately return an error which, although can be handled with exceptions, I consider affects the polymorphism of a function. To solve this problem, I created three functions dedicated to validating the user input, one that accepts only string characters from [A-Za-z]*, another one that accepts only numeric type input, and the last one that validates the format of the date, this last one was particularly harder because the input is both integers and non-letter/non-numerical characters within a string. I used if statements to validate the scannerâ€™s content to ensure the desired input was in the scanner before continuing. In the end, I was very proud of my findings as I was able to validate every input the user entered and utilized these three functions in over twenty different processes in the Driver class.
